# Minesweeper
Somewhat bad Minesweeper 
This is a bad version of of the game Minesweeper.
You do not have flags to mark where the bombs are so you just have to work around them
You also don't get a break of the start most of the time.
You control your settings, You can make it super easy or completely impossible, it's your choice
GOOD LUCK!
